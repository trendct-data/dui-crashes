# Obtaining data

I started off by downloading all (1995-2014) crash data from
ctcrash.uconn.edu with "driving under the influence" as a contributing
factor. Those files are in the data/export_25955/ directory of this repository.

# Analysis

Analysis based on hour of day, hour of year, day of week, day of year are
found in CT DUI-related crashes .ipynb notebook file.
